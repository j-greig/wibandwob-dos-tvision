  Composable audio synthesis toolkit for building chiptune music from numpy primitives.
  Three layers: oscillators/effects/theory (raw materials), patterns (compositional gestures),
  pipeline (pydub bridge, mixing, splicing, voice, export). Use when composing original
  music for video reels, generating stingers/interstitials, mixing voiceover with score,
  or any task requiring programmatic audio synthesis. Triggers on: music composition,
  chiptune generation, audio scoring, sound design, stinger creation, reel audio mixing.

# Chiptune Bricks

Composable audio synthesis. Numpy in, sound out.

## Architecture

Three layers, each building on the last:

```
PRIMITIVES   osc · fx · theory · canvas    raw waveforms, effects, note math, mixing
PATTERNS     patterns                       compositional gestures that place sounds in time
PIPELINE     pipeline                       pydub bridge, file mixing, voice, export
```

All synthesis happens in numpy float64 at SR=22050. Pipeline bridges to pydub for
file operations (MP3 export, voice mixing, splicing).

## audioop-lts Required

Python 3.13+ removed the `audioop` module that pydub depends on. **Always include
`audioop-lts`** in script dependencies or pydub will crash with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'audioop'`. This is not optional.

## Quick Start

```python
# Every composition script needs this header for uv:
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.10"
# dependencies = ["numpy", "scipy", "pydub", "audioop-lts"]
# ///
# NOTE: audioop-lts is REQUIRED — pydub breaks without it on Python 3.13+

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "~/Repos/symbient-skills/skills/chiptune-bricks/scripts")

from bricks import *

# Make a 30-second canvas, place sounds, export
c = canvas.make(30)
c = canvas.place(c, patterns.arp(["C3","E3","G3","B3"], 30, bpm=90), 0.0)
c = canvas.place(c, patterns.drone("C2", 30), 0.0, vol=0.3)
c = canvas.normalize(c)
canvas.save_wav(c, "output.wav")
```

## How to Compose

This is a toolkit, not a jukebox. The bricks are verbs. You supply the nouns.

### Creative Heuristics

When composing, think in these dimensions rather than mapping moods to presets:

**Density** — how many simultaneous layers? Two clean voices that breathe carry more
weight than six muddy ones. Start sparse, add only what earns its place.

**Register** — where in the frequency spectrum? Low instruments feel heavy, anchoring.
High instruments feel exposed, fragile. The gap between them is where tension lives.

**Movement** — what changes over time? A static drone under an evolving arp creates
contrast. Everything moving at once creates chaos (sometimes you want chaos).

**Texture** — smooth vs gritty? Bitcrush depth is the primary texture knob.
6 = warm grit. 4 = NES character. 2 = deliberate destruction. No crush = clean,
vulnerable, exposed. Texture carries emotional information.

**Space** — where is the silence? Silence after noise hits harder than noise after
noise. A rest in an arp pattern (via skip_fn) creates anticipation. Fade-ins
give the ear time to adjust. Space is a compositional choice, not absence.

**Arc** — does the piece go somewhere? Energy can build (additive layers),
decay (subtractive, progressive bitcrush), breathe (swell and retreat),
or fracture (structured patterns breaking down). The arc serves the narrative.

### The Skip-First-Idea Rule

The obvious musical choice for a given narrative is almost never the interesting one.
When you reach for C minor... stop. When you default to 4/4 at 120bpm... stop.
Log the first instinct, then make a different choice. The second or third idea
carries the composer's actual thinking rather than pattern-matching.

### Influences Percolate

Don't build lookup tables (sad → minor, happy → major). Instead, let multiple
influences inform decisions simultaneously:

- The narrative's pacing and emotional weight
- Whatever musical references feel resonant (not prescriptive genre-matching)
- Physical constraints (duration, voice frequency range to avoid)
- What you HAVEN'T done recently (check compose-fingerprints.jsonl)
- Random constraints as creative fuel (forced tempo, waveform bans, layer limits)

These inputs create a field of possibilities. The composition emerges from their
intersection, not from any single input dictating the output.

### Structural Thinking

Pieces have sections. Sections have layers. Layers have sounds.

Common structural moves (not rules, just vocabulary):
- **Additive**: start with one voice, add layers over time
- **Subtractive**: start full, remove or degrade elements
- **Call and response**: two voices alternating
- **Pointillist**: isolated events with space between them
- **Drone-and-detail**: sustained bed with moving elements over it

Transitions between sections: crossfade, silence gap, filter sweep, rhythmic
break, new element entering early (foreshadowing).

## Pattern Reference

Full API docs for all functions: `references/pattern-catalog.md`

Read that file when you need parameter details, function signatures, or usage
examples. What follows here is the conceptual vocabulary.

### Pattern Vocabulary (gestures, not recipes)

| Pattern | What it does | Compositional role |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `arp` | Cycles notes at tempo | Harmonic motion, pulse, melodic backbone |
| `sequencer` | Beat grid with hit patterns | Rhythmic foundation, groove |
| `sparkle` | Rapid note cascade | Accent, transition, shimmer |
| `drone` | Sustained tone bed | Foundation, mood, harmonic anchor |
| `ghost_echo` | Delayed octave-shifted replica | Depth, haunting, doubling |
| `noise_breath` | Filtered noise bursts | Organic texture, air between tones |
| `sub_rumble` | Ultra-low sine | Subsonic weight, physical sensation |
| `stinger_hits` | Escalating hit sequence | Punctuation, drama, tension build |
| `resolve` | Clean sustained note | Emotional payoff, release, ending |

### Effect Vocabulary

| Effect | Sonic character | Compositional use |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| `bitcrush` | Digital grit | Texture control (depth 2-8 range) |
| `tremolo` | Amplitude wobble | Movement in static sounds |
| `reverb` | Metallic room | Space, lo-fi depth |
| `delay` | Discrete echoes | Rhythmic complexity, space |
| `lowpass` | Warmth, muffling | Distance, intimacy, frequency masking |
| `highpass` | Thinning | Isolation, fragility |
| `env` | ADSR shape | Attack character, sustain, release tail |

## Pipeline Operations

When the composition needs to leave numpy world:

- `canvas.to_pydub(audio)` / `canvas.from_pydub(segment)` — the bridge
- `pipeline.mix_layers()` — overlay multiple AudioSegments at dB offsets
- `pipeline.splice_at()` — insert audio at a precise timecode
- `pipeline.duck_envelope()` — generate sidechain gain curve from voice
- `pipeline.say_to_segment()` — macOS TTS → AudioSegment
- `pipeline.export_mp3()` — standard export with optional normalize + fade
- `canvas.mix_with_voice()` — quick numpy music + voice file → MP3

## Dependencies

```
numpy, scipy, pydub, audioop-lts
```

All scripts should use `uv run` with inline metadata:
```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.10"
# dependencies = ["numpy", "scipy", "pydub", "audioop-lts"]
# ///
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Reimplementing oscillators in every script (use `from bricks import *`)
- Defaulting to C minor at 120bpm (the chiptune uncanny valley)
- Six layers when two would breathe better (if the narrative is 'simple', that is)
- Ignoring silence as a compositional element
- Keeping the same pacing and key for the entire piece
- Mood→preset lookup tables instead of genuine creative decisions
- Forgetting the numpy/pydub boundary (synthesis in numpy, file ops in pydub)
